Set up Ingress on Minikube with the NGINX Ingress Controller

run minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
kubectl create deployment web --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
kubectl expose deployment web --type=NodePort --port=8080
kubectl get service web
minikube service web --url (The output is similar to: http://172.17.0.15:31637)
curl http://172.17.0.15:31637 
Create example-ingress.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
    - host: hello-world.info
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: web
                port:
                  number: 8080

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/networking/example-ingress.yaml

Verify the IP address is set:

kubectl get ingress
Note: This can take a couple of minutes.
You should see an IPv4 address in the ADDRESS column; for example:

NAME              CLASS    HOSTS              ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
example-ingress   <none>   hello-world.info   172.17.0.15    8

Verify that the Ingress controller is directing traffic:

curl --resolve "hello-world.info:80:$( minikube ip )" -i http://hello-world.info

You can also visit hello-world.info from your browser.

Optionally Look up the external IP address as reported by minikube:

minikube ip
Add line similar to the following one to the bottom of the /etc/hosts file on your computer (you will need administrator access):

172.17.0.15 hello-world.info
